                            <p>I'm an aspiring 3d artist from the small town of Meersburg in northern Germany. I'm only 17 and don't have a decent creative 
                                history or impressive portfolio yet, but I'm looking to fix that. I live alone, since childhood I have been fond of 
                                technology and the exact sciences. I have not bad programming skills and I am very into art. My love for art was born 
                                after a few years ago I visited the Louvre with my parents. The grandiose building, covered from top to bottom with 
                                paintings by famous artists, left an unforgettable impression. Since then, I have become interested not only in ordinary, 
                                but also in generative painting. I review every project presented on your platform, and I believe that someday my work will appear there as well.

                                        <p>One day, being delighted with another generative project presented by you, I decided to create 
                                            something of my own, something new, and something that was not yet on your platform. This is 
                                            how the idea for the Loops Of Life project came about.</p>
                                        <p>Each painting is as unique as the life of each person. For some, it is replete with bright colors, 
                                            for someone, on the contrary, it is executed in black and white. But all of them are united by 
                                            one thing - an endless movement, symbolizing the infinity of our life.</p>

                                </div>

                                    <div class="frame-media first-frame animate quadrat" style="background-image: url(images/34.webp)"></div>
                                    <div class="text-content animate">
                                        <p>I pay special attention to paintings executed in black and white colors. They symbolize the endless 
                                            struggle between good and evil in our world, the cyclical nature of victories and defeats in human life, 
                                            moving forward, even if everything around is collapsing. They represent balance and strength.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, the paintings, executed in colorful colors, personify, first of all, childhood. 
                                            A carefree childhood filled with bright colors, new discoveries, new victories and achievements every day. </p>
